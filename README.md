## My Research

I am researching the feedbacks between biofilm growth, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and preferential flowpaths in porous media. I spent the summer of 2022 developing a new microfluidic device to emulate hyporheic flow (flow through shallow streambed sediments), and establishing proof of concept for the device's ability to allow researchers to collect time-series images of biofilm growth and the formation of anoxic hotspots simultaneously. With data collected from images of this flowcell in operation I will analyze the relationship between the bacteria growth and anoxic zones, and fit this analysis to the change in preferential flow through the pore space.
Scientific computing will be essential in my image analysis as well as developing a model from experimental data.

## SMART Goals

 SMART | Goals
-------|-----------
 S | Specific 
 M | Measurable 
 A | Achievable 
 R | Relevant 
 T | Time-Bound 

1. By the end of the semester I will have a strong grasp on the syntax and structure of coding with Python.
2. I will familiarize myself with image processing techniques available in Python.
3. I will develop a script to "look at" collected images and separate the bacterial colonies from the grains (via a mask of the flowcell with no growth).
